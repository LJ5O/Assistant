# Docker Database

This folder contains a *Docker Compose* file used to prepare a database, compatible with our **Brain** subprocess.

This database is **mainly for development** purposes, but may be adapted for production if needed.
> If you try to use this docker file in production, be sure to at least **secure the Adminer service**, and **change the default login/password** of the database !
