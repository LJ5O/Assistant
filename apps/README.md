# Apps directory

This folder contains all applications directly exposed to end-users. For example, the *VueJS* website.

For example, if we want to develop a Discord bot, so we can query the assistant directly from Discord, then it would be added here.

If we want our assistant to come and play with us *Minecraft*, the bot would not be stored under the `/apps` path, as end-users may interact with the in-game bot, but this is launched by another process.
