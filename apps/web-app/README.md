# web-app

This folder contains a *VueJs* website (**front-end**), that can be used to communicate with the **back-end**.

**As this project is still in early stages of development, web-app expects the API to be hosted at 127.0.0.1:3000 !** Parameters to change this are coming soon !

## Installation

npm i --include=dev

Then, launch the project with

You can also run some tests, for checking types, or running *Cypress* for e2e tests.
